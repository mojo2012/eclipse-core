# eclipse-core
This is a minimal Eclipse Oxygen macOS app. To use it, just clone the repository and rename it to "**Eclipse Core.app**".

The idea behind this setup is, to be able to reset the installation via ```git reset --hard```, eg. after trying some plugins that messed up your installation. Additionally it allows to create versioned installations, using different settings or plugins.
